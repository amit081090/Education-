        <P class="sectionTag text-big">Facts about rural schools in india</P>
        <P class="sectionSubTag text-small">Most schools in India were built by the government in 
            the 1930’s and 1940’s. In the years since, many rural schools have deteriorated into crumbling
             structures that suffer from leaks and unsafe conditions. Exposure to the elements and non-existent 
             or substandard water, sanitation and hygiene facilities can expose students to disease and distract 
             from quality learning experiences. Even in the best school conditions, economic insecurity and distance 
             between school and home can result in rural families choosing to send their children to work rather 
            than receiving a formal education. OSAAT is working one school at a time to combat these trends.?
